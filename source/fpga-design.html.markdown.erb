####FPGA design

QBayLogic provides FPGA design services for your outsourcing needs.  We provide:

* HDL programming (using C位aSH)
* IP core design
* Design modification

Although QBayLogic can handle all aspects of FPGA design, from data-oriented circuits to control-oriented circuits, we focus in particular on mapping tough mathematical algorithms to FPGAs. QBayLogic is exceptionally qualified qualified to do this for two reasons:

* [Our team](our-team.html) has a strong affinity with mathematics.
* Our technology, the [C位aSH compiler](about-clash.html), allows us to basically "write mathematical specifications in typewriter font", and formally derive an FPGA implementation that meets the performance criteria in a correct-by-construction manner.

Our C位aSH compiler significantly improves our productivity, allowing us to create designs in much shorter design cycles, resulting in:

* Much shorter time-to-market for your product.
* Highly competitive prices for our design services.

####Application acceleration

FPGAs are an uncommon platform for acceleration of applications, due to the programming difficulties associated with the traditional hardware description languages for the FPGA platform: VHDL and/or Verilog.

Depending on the application however, FPGAs are a very interesting platform for acceleration:

* Complex data movements are translated to rearrangements of wire endpoints, instead of copying memory. Transposition of a matrix is for example a completely free operation on an FPGA.
* Operators can have custom precision to meet the error rates for the application.
* FPGAs are very low-power devices meaning that they can be used in environments where large cooling solutions are impractical, or can be tightly packed together in standard server environments.
* FPGAs can directly connect to peripherals such as 10GBit ethernet ports, providing unprecedented low latency networked computing.

Using our [C位aSH compiler](about-clash.html), instead of the traditional VHDL or Verilog languages, programming FPGA devices becomes significantly easier. In combination with [our team](http://localhost:4567/our-team.html)'s strong affinity for mathematics, QBayLogic can straightforwardly accellerate your complex algorithms on FPGAs.
