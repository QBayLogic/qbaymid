We just released a new and convenient way to get started with Clash: a
starter project based on Stack. To get started,
[install Stack](https://www.fpcomplete.com/haskell/get-started/). Next, open a
terminal and type:

```
stack new my-clash-project clash-lang/simple
```

Your project will be instantiated in `my-clash-project/` and is ready to be
built. To do so, type:

```
stack build
```

To run the tests in the project, run:

```
stack test
```

To compile to VHDL, run:

```
stack run clash -- Test.Example --vhdl
```

And that's all there is to it! The directory includes a `README.md` giving you
an overview of the project and how to extend it. Alternatively, you can
[read it online too](https://github.com/clash-lang/clash-starters/tree/main/simple).
Happy Clashing!

**Note**: Due to [an upstream bug](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/18550),
these instructions are currently broken on Windows Build 2004. This is expected
to be fixed with the release of GHC 8.10.3. We will update the starter project
and remove this message as soon as that happens. In the meantime, consider using
WSL2 to run Clash.
