The [Clash compiler](about-clash.html) is an open-source project with an active and helpful community, and has community resources such as blog posts on how to use Clash. There might however be situations where you want a more direct form of support. Such situations might include:

* You want phone support for the Clash compiler.
* You need an active developer to fix a certain bug in the Clash compiler. Or you need a developer to fix a bug that only shows up in code available under an NDA.
* You require a new feature to be added to the Clash compiler, or require a custom version of the  Clash compiler. The latter can occur when there is no community consensus about a particular (disruptive) change.
* You quickly need to knows things like: ¨What is the best way to do this in Clash?¨, or ¨How do I generalize this  Clash code?¨

As the creators of Clash, QBayLogic can provide expert help in situations as described above, and many other situations. [Contact us](contact-us.html) if you need our help using Clash.
