The [CλaSH compiler](about-clash.html) is an open-source project with an active and helpful community, and community resources such as blog posts on how to use CλaSH. There might however be situations where you want a more direct form of support. Such situations might include:

* You want phone support for the CλaSH compiler.
* You need an active developer to fix a certain bug in the CλaSH compiler. Or you need a developer to fix a bug that only shows up in code available under an NDA.
* You require a new feature to be added to the CλaSH compiler, or require a custom version of the  CλaSH compiler. The latter can occur when there is no community consensus about a particular (disruptive) change.
* You quickly need to knows things like: ¨What is the best way to do this in CλaSH?¨, or ¨How do I generalize this  CλaSH code?¨

As the creators of CλaSH, QBayLogic can provide expert help in situations as described above, and many more. [Contact us](contact-us.html) if you need our help using CλaSH.
