Based on over 30 years of teaching experience at the University of Twente, we provide engaging tutorials and workshops to use our C位aSH technology on your problems.
We offer different workshops for different audiences:

* Workshops for seasoned HDL/FPGA developers who want to get acquainted with our C位aSH technology.
* Workshops for developers who want to accelerate applications on FPGAs.
* And workshops on the advanced aspects of circuit design in C位aSH.

The material for our workshops easily be altered to fit both single-day and multi-day event.
Workshops can be hosted at our location, or your location.
