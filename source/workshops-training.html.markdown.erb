####Training

QBayLogic offers professional training courses to bring your team to a level where they can confidently start developing circuits using Clash.
The material has its basis in our decade(s) long experience teaching B.Sc.-level functional programming and M.Sc.-level Computer Architecture Design classes that we taught at the University of Twente in The Netherlands and has been adapted and used in training people in industry.

We offer single-day workshops on specific topics and multi-day training sessions to bring your team up to speed. Our training sessions have multiple entry levels:

* No prior functional programming experience, nor circuit design experience
* Prior functional programming experience, but no circuit design experience
* Prior functional programming experience and circuit design experience

Together with you, we construct a curriculum suited to your team’s needs, selecting from the following modules:

* Module 1: Introduction to functional programming
* Module 2: Introduction to digital circuits and FPGAs
* Module 3: Circuit design with Clash
* Module 4: Circuit from formulas - correct-by-construction
* Module 5: CPU design
* Module 6: Verification in Clash
* Module 7: Integrating existing IP
* Module 8: Customer challenge

[Check out our syllabus](Syllabus.pdf) to discover what you will lear from every module.
We especially encourage our customers to make “M8: Customer challenge” part of their curriculum.
In it, QBayLogic will take on one of your current design challenges and present the solution in an interactive fashion.
It has been our experience that this results in the best engagement and subsequent retention of the material.
