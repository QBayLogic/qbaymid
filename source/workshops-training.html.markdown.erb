Based on over 30 years of teaching experience at the University of Twente, we provide engaging tutorials and workshops to use our Clash technology on your problems.
We offer different workshops for different audiences:

* Workshops for seasoned HDL/FPGA developers who want to get acquainted with our Clash technology.
* Workshops for developers who want to accelerate applications on FPGAs.
* And workshops on the advanced aspects of circuit design in Clash.

The material for our workshops can easily be altered to fit both single-day and multi-day events.
Workshops can be hosted at our location, or your location.
